Administrators are able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes

This app will calculate when the next train will arrive, relative to the current time.

Once Administrator completes form and clicks Submit, the new Train will append to the bottom of the Train table, which is visible to anyone using the app.
